# Demo ACF Blocks

These are mostly for demonstration purposes.

Notes on each block's purpose.

## Phone Number

The `Phone Number` ACF Block is a simple block. It relies on builders to update the Phone Number in the custom ACF Options Page that is created by the Demo ACF Plugin (see: `includes/acf-settings-page.php`) at Site Settings > Contact Info. This allows builder to update it in one place, while being able to drag and drop the block anywhere on the site to display the phone number.
